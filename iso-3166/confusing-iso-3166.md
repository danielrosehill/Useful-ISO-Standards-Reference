# Confusing ISO-3166 Alpha 2s

This table provides some ISO-3166 Alpha 2s that are somewhat unexpected and liable to trip up cocky data researchers who are certain that they've committed every ISO standard out there to memory. 

ISO-3166 values are less arcane than they seem given their high utility in standardising datasets on a set of unified descriptors for countries and geographical territories.

## Group 1: Countries Using Native Language Names

### Algeria
Alpha 2: DZ  
Alpha 3: DZA

Comes from "Dzayer" (Arabic) rather than English.

### Germany
Alpha 2: DE  
Alpha 3: DEU

From "Deutschland" (German) rather than "Germany".

### Greece
Alpha 2: GR  
Alpha 3: GRC

From "Graecia" (Latin) rather than "Greece". The Alpha-3 "GRC" comes from the historical Greek name.

### Spain
Alpha 2: ES  
Alpha 3: ESP

From "España" (Spanish) rather than "Spain".


### Switzerland
Alpha 2: CH  
Alpha 3: CHE

From "Confoederatio Helvetica" (Latin) rather than any modern language version.

### Croatia

### South Korea
Alpha 2: KR

## Group 2: Other Confusing Cases

### Antarctica
Alpha 2: AQ  
Alpha 3: ATA

"AQ" is unexpected - doesn't follow the usual "AN" pattern you might expect.

### Cayman Islands

Alpha 3: CYM

Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 don't follow the usual matching pattern.

### United Kingdom
Alpha 2: GB  
Alpha 3: GBR

From "Great Britain" rather than "United Kingdom" - commonly mistaken for "UK".

### Myanmar (Burma)
Alpha 2: MM  
Alpha 3: MMR

Uses "MM" from "Myanmar" rather than "BU" from "Burma".
